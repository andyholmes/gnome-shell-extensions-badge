Logo and fonts are important when using GNOME trademarks, so please don't distribute changes without obtaining permission from the GNOME Foundation (it's really easy and they're very nice).

I have a rather amateur sense of alignment and design and it's english only. If someone were inclined to take this on as a more official project, F-Droid has some scripts for generating PNGs and internationalised badges in their artwork repository at https://gitlab.com/fdroid/artwork/tree/master/badge that could be adapted.
